Note: Audio feature is only available when setup project with wrlinux-std-sato distro
that includes DISTRO_FEATURES "pulseaudio".

5.2 CAN Bus
-----------

There are 2 CAN bus ports on base-board(Kingfisher), CN17 and CN18.
Connect the 2 ports with cable and run below command to verify CAN bus feature.

5.2.1 Set up can0 and can1
--------------------------

	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000
	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000
	# ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1000
	# ifconfig can1 txqueuelen 1000

5.2.2 send data from can1 and dump data from can0
-------------------------------------------------

	# candump can0 &
	# cangen can1
	or
	# cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88

5.2.2 check the data sending and receiving on can0 and can1
-----------------------------------------------------------

	# ip -details -statistics link show can0
	# ip -details -statistics link show can1

5.3 suspend/resume
------------------

On renesas-rcar platform, only support for suspend to freeze witd below command:

	# echo freeze > /sys/power/state

System is able to be waked up by some external events. 
For example, wake up system by console terminal.
Enable serial wake up feature with below command before entering suspend status,
and add no_console_suspend parameter in bootargs.

	# echo enabled > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/sh-sci/e6e88000.serial/tty/ttySC0/power/wakeup

Pressing any key can wake up system.

Note:
There is a known issue about usb3.0 on base-board(Kingfisher).
When system resumes from suspend status, xhci controller can't communicate with
external hub chip normally, the hub chip always return busy status and
cause usb3.0 re-enable failed.


5.4 USB feature
---------------

5.4.1 USB OTG Usage and verification
------------------------------------

1. Verify the OTG device mode

Connect CN13 on base-board(Kingfisher) to the host machine.

Run below command to simulate as u-disk:

	# modprobe g_mass_storage file=/dev/mmcblk1p1 stall=0 removable=1

2. Switch to OTG host mode

Connect CN13 on base-board(Kingfisher) with U-disk.

5.5 PCIe
--------

There is a mini-pcie port on base-board(Kingfisher) CN15.
The following PCIe peripherals:

	Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6200
	Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030

 are used to verify PCIe feature with the following steps:

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

	KERNEL_FEATURES_append = " features/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.scc"

This will include the iwlwifi and mac80211 kernel modules in
the root filesystem.

Built and install them:

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-glibc-xxx

Copy relevant WiFi card firmware (Intel 6200 WiFi firmware: iwlwifi-6000-4.ucode)
of to /lib/firmware of the target image.

Execute the following commands to validate the WiFi cards:

	# ifconfig wlan0 up
	# iw wlan0 scan
	# iw dev wlan0 connect <AP essid>
	# dhclient wlan0
	# ping <AP address> -i wlan0 -c 5

5.6 Bluetooth
-------------

There is a TI-WL18xx BT-WF modules on base-board(Kingfisher), customer could connect
other BT device with renesas-rcar platform. Below 2 examples are able to be used to
verify Bluetooth feature.

5.6.1 Scan other BT devices
---------------------------
Run below commands to Scan other BT devices

	# hciconfig hci0 up
	# hcitool -i hci0 scan

5.6.2 Play audio with Bluetooth
-------------------------------
Run below commands to play aduio from another device that connects with renesas-rcar platform by Bluetooth.

	# bluetoothctl
	Agent registered
	[bluetooth]# power on
	Changing power on succeeded
	[bluetooth]# agent on
	Agent is already registered
	[bluetooth]# default-agent
	Default agent request successful
	[bluetooth]# scan on
	Discovery started
	..(snip)..  !!! <-- Please look for taget device !!!
	[bluetooth]# scan off
	..(snip)..
	[bluetooth]# pair <MAC address of target device>
	..(snip)..
	Request confirmation
	[agent] Confirm passkey 285311 (yes/no): yes
	..(snip)..
	Pairing successful
	[bluetooth]# connect <MAC address of target device>
	..(snip)..
	Connection successful
	..(snip)..
	[Target device name]# quit

Connect headset or speaker with CN32/CN33 on base-board(Kingfisher), and then play music on target device.

5.7 CANFD BUS
-------------

There are 2 CANFD BUS ports(canfd0 and canfd1) on base-board(Kingfisher), CN17 and CN18.
They use the same ports with CAN BUS(can0 and can1). The CAN BUS is enabled by default.
So, if customer wants to use CANFD BUS, it is need to enable canfd0 and canfd1, and then
disable can0 and can1 in dts file.

5.7.1 Enable CANFD BUS
----------------------

There are 2 methods to enable canfd0 and canfd1 while disable can0 and can1.

 - Modify DTS file ulcb-kf.dtsi manually
   Firstly, disable can0 and can1 nodes in ulcb-kf.dtsi
	&can0 {
		...
		status = "disabled";
	};

	&can1 {
		...
		status = "disabled";
	};
    Secondly, enable canfd node in ulcb-kf.dtsi
	&canfd {
		...
		status = "okay";
		...
	};

 - Modify DTB file with fdt command during boot system
   There is an example as below, download dtb file with tftp
	# tftpboot 0x48000000 <host ip>:<path-to-dtb>/r8a7795-h3ulcb-kf.dtb
	# fdt addr 0x48000000
	# fdt resize
	# fdt set /soc/can@e6c30000 status disabled
	# fdt set /soc/can@e6c38000 status disabled
	# fdt set /soc/can@e66c0000 status okay

5.7.2 Verify CANFD BUS
----------------------
The verification method is the similar with verifying CAN BUS.
Connect the 2 ports(CN17 and CN18) with cable and run below command.

5.7.2.1 Set up canfd0 and canfd1
------------------------------

	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 800000 fd on
	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 800000 fd on

5.7.2.2 send data from canfd1 and dump data from canfd0
-------------------------------------------------------

	# candump can0 &
	# cangen can1
	or
	# cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88

5.7.2.2 check the data sending and receiving on canfd0 and canfd1
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	# ip -details -statistics link show can0
	# ip -details -statistics link show can1


6. kexec/kdump
==============

You need to add feature/kexec,feature/kdump templates support as follow:

	./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines renesas-rcar --templates feature/kexec,feature/kdump

6.1 kexec
---------

	kexec -l  /root/Image.gz --append="`cat /proc/cmdline`"
	kexec -e

6.2 kdump
---------

Add crashkernel=380M@1408M to the kernel cmdline
   kexec -p /root/Image.gz --append="$your-bootcmd"
   echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

Note:
Before booting the second kernel, add "maxcpus=1 cma=128M" to the boot parameter.

For more detailed info about kdump, refer to Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
in the kernel source tree.


7. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/renesas-rcar/wrlinux-image-glibc-std-renesas-rcar.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

7.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn WIC images to SD card, run below command:

	$ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-<rootfs_type>-renesas-rcar.wic of=/dev/sdx

7.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile r8a7795-h3ulcb-kf.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x48080000; setenv fdtaddr 0x48000000;

=> setenv bootargs 'console=ttySC0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 ignore_loglevel rw no_console_suspend rootwait ip=dhcp'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

7.3 Delpoy sd card
------------------

Insert sd card into CN6 of the top-board(H3SK/M3SK)


8. Multilib
===========

By default, this BSP is configured as a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit userspace.
If a full 32-bit filesystem is necessary, use the prefix "lib32-" before
the expected target image as follows:

	# bitbake lib32-wrlinux-image-glibc-std


9. Multimedia Layer
===================

This layer includes recipes of graphic and multimedia feature.
If customer wants to enable GPU hardware accelerator, please add this
layer before building image. With this layer, customer can get a
image with weston desktop based on wayland protocol.

Next sections show how to use the multimedia layer.

9.1 Setup project with weston template
--------------------------------------

The GPU hardware accelerating library is based on wayland protocol, and
it is need to use weston as the desktop. So setup project with with weston template.
Detail command as below:

	# <path-of-wrlinux-x>/setup.sh --machine renesas-rcar-h3 --distro wrlinux-std-sato --dl-layers --all-layers --accept-eula=yes --templates feature/weston-demo

Note: The distro should be wrlinux-std-sato.

9.2 Download Library and kernel module
--------------------------------------
